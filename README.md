# Escape: A Storey
Created for study as part of USC CSCE 247.

Your task is to escape the M. Bert Storey Research and Innovation Center. All the doors are locked, (nearly) everyone has gone home, and you turned into a squirrel. Boom ðŸ¤¯! 

Along the way you'll encounter a cast of characters highly interested in making sure you know theoretical computer science --- Any resemblance to persons living or dead is purely coincidental.

Through at least 3 bombastic, blathering, and challenging floors, you'll be challenged in a way you've never been challenged since last semester. 


---

Our project is an escape room in which you escape the M. Bert Storey Research and Innovation Center. You will progress through the floors by interacting with objects in the world through four primary actions, each with unique dialog: Interact, Inspect, Attack, and Text Input. Using these four options allows for many possible ways to solve a given problem while still being circumscribed enough that the player doesn't feel overwhelmed with possibilities.

Our project scores players based on how long they take to complete the course, a metric which it then stores with a username and hashed password.
