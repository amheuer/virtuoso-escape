# Escape: A Storey
Created for study as part of USC CSCE 247.

Your task is to escape the M. Bert Storey Research in Innovation Center. All the doors are locked, (nearly) everyone has gone home, and you turned into a squirrel. Boom ðŸ¤¯! 

Along the way you'll encounter a cast of characters highly interested in making sure you know theoretical computer science --- Any resemblance to persons living or dead is purely coincidental.

Through at least 3 bombastic, blathering, and challenging floors, you'll be challenged in a way you've never been challenged since last semester.
